# Image_Classification_Using_CNN

Image recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a best approach for tasks such as object detection, image classification, and segmentation.Popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, Keras are used for building and training CNNs for image recognition tasks. Additionally, pre-trained CNN model is used, which can be fine-tuned or used directly for specific tasks, saving time and computational resources.
